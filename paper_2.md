## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods
We love fuzzy systems, so choosing this AB fractional hybrids (excuse our jargon) was our study sytem.
By applying a lot of numbers and fractioning them in Hilbert space, more numbrs were calculated.
Then applied fuzzy statistics in an attempt to solve a hybrid problem. 
We think this may work.

## Discussion

We have proven that our numerical approach in the Hilbert space is successful in solving the fuzzy Atangana-Baleanu fractional hybrid system.
We believe this approach will be extremely helpful in further investigation of fuzzy fractional hybrid system, and propose further investigation of other numerical approaches.
