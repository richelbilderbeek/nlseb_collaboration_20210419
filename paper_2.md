## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods

## Discussion

We have proven that our numerical approach in the Hilbert space is successful in solving the fuzzy Atangana-Baleanu fractional hybrid system.
We believe this approach will be extremely helpful in further investigation of fuzzy fractional hybrid system, and propose further investigation of other numerical approaches.
