## Abstract

## Introduction

## Methods
We love fuzzy systems, so choosing this AB fractional hybrids (excuse our jargon) was our study sytem.
By applying a lot of numbers and fractioning them in Hilbert space, more numbrs were calculated.
Then applied fuzzy statistics in an attempt to solve a hybrid problem. 
We think this may work.
