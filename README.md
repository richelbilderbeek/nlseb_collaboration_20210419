# Online collaboration using git and GitHub

[NLSEB PhD and Postdoc Day](http://nlseb.nl/nlseb2021-phd-postdoc-meeting/) workshop: online collaboration using git and GitHub

 * When: Monday April 19 2021 10.45 - 12.15 in Workshop session I
 * Where: Zoom (link will be here when known)

## Description

In this hands-on introductory workshop,
we will work on a (nonsense, plain-text) manuscript together as a team.
As an exemplary team member, you will create tasks,
assign yourself and show what you are working on,
using a GitHub Project Page.
Additionally, using git, we will keep a version history, that both
allows us to work independently, as well as to merge our work.

It is assumed you have a (free) GitHub account
and git (e.g. 'Git Bash' for Windows) installed.

Please send your GitHub username to richel@richelbilderbeek.nl
before April 19th 9:00.
