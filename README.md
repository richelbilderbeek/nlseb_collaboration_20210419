# Online collaboration using git and GitHub

NLSEB PhD and Postdoc Day workshop: online collaboration using git and GitHub

## Description

In this hands-on introductory workshop,
we will work on a (nonsense, plain-text) manuscript together as a team.
As an exemplary team member, you will create tasks,
assign yourself and show what you are working on,
using a GitHub Project Page.
Additionally, using git, we will keep a version history, that both
allows us to work independently, as well as to merge our work.

It is assumed you have a (free) GitHub account
and git (e.g. 'Git Bash' for Windows) installed.

Please send your GitHub username to richel@richelbilderbeek.nl
before April 19th 9:00.
